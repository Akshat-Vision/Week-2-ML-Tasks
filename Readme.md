# Voice Morph Companion 
## Introduction
This is a project taken up by Electronics Club in the Summer of 2024. The Project involves implementing a Chatbot on Raspberry Pi, Audio Classification on Arduino Nano BLE and Constructing a touch screen using IR WAV. 

The Repository Contains the Resources of Project Clearly documented in week wise progress. Please contact Electronics Club of IIT Kanpur for any further details of the Project. 

### Week 1 
In week 1,We focus on various topics such as basic Python programming, machine learning, support vector machines, and libraries. The aim is to provide foundational knowledge and hands-on practice through structured assignments and examples.

### Week 2

In Week 2, we dive deeper into the world of machine learning, covering topics of Simple Supervised Machine Learning,Some Essential components of Data Analysis, Clustering (Unsupervised Machine Learning) and Introduction to Deep Learning 

### Week 3 

In Week 3, We work on concepts of Audio Processing and how can they be integrated with ML,After this we CNN and their implementation is emphasized. We end this week with a Banger Assignment on Audio Classification to find instruments on TinySOL Dataset. 

### Week 4
1. Natural Language Processing 
2. Audio Classification

- The NLP let you learn basic NLP techniques and work on using SVM on text.
- The Audio Classification let you learn to implement the Audio Classification Model on Arduino Nano BLE and Extracting Data from Serial and storing them in a CSV file.
