### Week 1 
In week 1,We focus on various topics such as basic Python programming, machine learning, support vector machines, and libraries. The aim is to provide foundational knowledge and hands-on practice through structured assignments and examples.

### Week 2

In Week 2, we dive deeper into the world of machine learning, covering topics of Simple Supervised Machine Learning,Some Essential components of Data Analysis, Clustering (Unsupervised Machine Learning) and Introduction to Deep Learning 

### Week 3 

In Week 3, We work on concepts of Audio Processing and how can they be integrated with ML,After this we CNN and their implementation is emphasized. We end this week with a Banger Assignment on Audio Classification to find instruments on TinySOL Dataset. 

### Week 4

- The NLP will let you learn basic NLP techniques and work on using SVM on text.
- The Audio Classification will let you learn to implement the Audio Classification Model on Arduino Nano BLE and Extracting Data from Serial and storing them in a CSV file.
